Exercise 3.1
------------

Prove that the right spine of a leftist heap of size $n$ contains at most $\lfloor \log (n+1)\rfloor$ elements.

Suppose that $H$ is a leftist heap with $n$ elements.  And let $k$ be the length of the right spine of $H$. Since $H$ is leftist, every branch of $H$ has length $\geq k$, so that $H$ contains the complete binary tree of depth $k$.  Therefore, $n \geq 2^k - 1$, so that  $\log (n+1) \geq k$, which implies that $\lfloor \log (n + 1)\rfloor \geq k$ as desired.
