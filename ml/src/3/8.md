Exercise 3.8
------------

Recall that a red-black tree is a binary tree with nodes colored either red or black, which satisfies the following invariants: (i) no red node has a red child; (ii) every path from root to empty node contains the same number of black nodes.

Prove that the maximum depth of a node in a red-black tree of size $n$ is at most $2\lfloor \log (n + 1)\rfloor$.

Suppose that $T$ is a red-black tree with $n$ nodes.  And let $d$ be the depth of $T$, so that $T$ contains at least one branch $b$ of length $d$.   By the first invariant, $b$ contains at most $\lceil d/2 \rceil$ red nodes, so that $b$ must contain at least $\lfloor d / 2 \rfloor$ black nodes.  By the second invariant, it follows that every branch of $T$ has at least $\lfloor d / 2 \rfloor$ black nodes.  Thus, $T$ contains a complete binary tree of depth $\lfloor d / 2 \rfloor$, which itself contains $2 * \lfloor \log (n + 1) \rfloor >= d - 1$ nodes.  However, since $T$ has depth $d > \lfloor d / 2 \rfloor$, at least one node of $T$ does not occur in this tree.  So $2 * \lfloor \log (n + 1) \rfloor >= d$, as desired.
